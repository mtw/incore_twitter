incore_twitter is an extension for the TYPO3 Web Content Management System (http://www.typo3.org), providing a fancy, jQuery-based Twitter Ticker. The frontend look and feel of incore_twitter can be fully customized via CSS, while the extension itself can be configured via the TYPO3 backend or directly via TypoScript.
Development of this extension was heavily influenced by the jQuery Twitter Ticker presented and discussed on Tutorialzine (http://tutorialzine.com/2009/10/jquery-twitter-ticker/). See the original demo at http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2009/10/jquery-twitter-ticker/demo.html
